# Texas Holdem 
The Texas Holdem application can be used to simulate poker hands. 
Once launched, a user will be shown a poker board with empty hands and all 52 cards to choose from.
Users will be able to select their hand as well as the number of opponents and their hands. 
Based on the hands chosen, the program will show the implied odds or probability of winning and losing.
From the cards still available, the program will simulate the flop, turn and river.
After, the program will show which hand won.

The project will be done in python using the pygame library which is fast and easy to use for developers that have not had much experience with python or making programs that include UI. Github will be used for the version control.

## Installation

1. Make sure you have Python installed. You can download it from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. Install Pygame by running the following command: pip install pygame OR pip3 install pygame
3. Git clone https://github.com/cis3296s24/03-Texas-Holdem
4. Navigate to the project directory: cd projectName
5. To run the game, execute the following command in terminal: python homepage.py
6. or simply download the lastest release and run the homepage.exe file in the dist folder

Pygame should run and display, if issues, following tips may be helpful:
- **Main Branch**: Use for stable and latest releases.
- **Missing library/package to download**: If compiling error make sure to have all downloaded onto IDE: 
- joblib
- numpy
- pip
- pygame
- pygame-menu
- pyperclip
- scipy
- typing_extensions

## Conclusion
Over 4 weeks, we crafted a tool to assist poker players in their Texas Hold'em games. Born from our love for programming and poker, we developed a solution to simplify hand evaluation and enhance gameplay.

Using agile methods like Scrum, we worked collaboratively, adapting to changes and delivering improvements iteratively. Comprehensive testing ensured our program's reliability and accuracy, instilling confidence in its functionality.

As we conclude this phase, we thank everyone involved for their contributions. We're proud of what we've achieved and excited to see how our program will benefit poker players.

Thank you for considering Texas Hold'em for your poker needs. Happy coding, and may the best hand win!
