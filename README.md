# Texas Holdem Odds Calculator
The Teaxas Holdem Odds Calculator application can be used to simulate poker hands. 
Once launched, a user will be shown a poker board with empty hands and all 52 cards to choose from.
Users will be able to select their hand as well as the number of opponents and their hands. 
Based on the hands chosen, the program will show the implied odds or probability of winning and losing.
From the cards still available, the program will simulate the flop, turn and river.
After, the program will show which hand won.
